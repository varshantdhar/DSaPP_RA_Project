# DSaPP_RA_Project
This repository includes an exercise for aspiring DSaPP volunteers and research assistants to complete. It will help us understand what skills you have so we can find the best fit for you at DSaPP.

Please follow these steps:

1. Fork this repository.
2. Download the data for Kaggle's "Predicting Excitement at DonorsChoose.org" ([here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/kdd-cup-2014-predicting-excitement-at-donors-choose/data)).
3. Open a Jupyter notebook in your fork and save your work there:
  1. Do exploratory analysis. Do you see anything interesting?
  2. Tell us a data story. Find a case and tell us what happens with it.
  3. What questions would you ask the partner?
  4. (Optional) Build a model. What did you learn from it?
 
This exercise will end at 5 PM on Friday, October 18th. Please do not spend more than four hours on it. Email your fork's address to dsapp at uchicago.edu by the deadline, and we will respond by close of business on Monday.
