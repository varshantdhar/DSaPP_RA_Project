# DSaPP_RA_Project
This repository includes an exercise for aspiring DSaPP volunteers and research assistants to complete. It will help us understand what skills you have so we can find the best fit for you at DSaPP.

Please follow these steps:

1. Fork this repository. You can learn how to do that [here](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)
2. Download the data for Kaggle's "Predicting Excitement at DonorsChoose.org" ([here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/kdd-cup-2014-predicting-excitement-at-donors-choose/data)).
3. Create a Jupyter notebook or a RMarkdown file in your fork of this repository and that includes the following three (or four) sections:
  1. **Exploratory analysis**. Describe the dataset using counts, averages, frequency tabeles, and plots. Do you see anything interesting or potentially problematic?
  2. **A Data Story**. Find a specific interesting case in the data and tell us what happens with it. Provide evidence from the data that supports your narrative.
  3. **Questions for the Project Partner**. What questions would you ask the partner now that you have seen the data? What is missing that you might need to get from them or other data sources to do something useful with the data?
  4. (Optional) **Modeling**. Build a model with the data that predicts a quantity of interest, identifies underlying structure in the data, or explores a potentially important relationship among fields in the dataset. What did you learn from it? Why is it potentially useful or relevant to someone's decision making?
  5. Save your notebook and commit it with an informative message, then push the commit to your repository on github.
 
This exercise will end at 5 PM on Friday, October 18th. Please do not spend more than four hours on it. Email a link to your repository to dsapp at uchicago.edu by the deadline, and we will respond by close of business on Monday.
